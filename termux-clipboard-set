npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties@7.18.6: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained. Please use @babel/plugin-transform-class-properties instead.
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread@7.20.7: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained. Please use @babel/plugin-transform-object-rest-spread instead.
npm warn deprecated cucumber-tag-expressions@1.1.1: Package no longer supported. Contact Support at https://www.npmjs.com/support for more info.
npm warn deprecated gherkin@5.1.0: This package is now published under @cucumber/gherkin
npm warn deprecated cucumber-expressions@5.0.18: This package is now published under @cucumber/cucumber-expressions
npm warn deprecated cucumber-expressions@6.6.2: This package is now published under @cucumber/cucumber-expressions
npm warn deprecated cucumber@4.2.1: Cucumber is publishing new releases under @cucumber/cucumber
npm warn deprecated core-js@2.6.12: core-js@<3.23.3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Some versions have web compatibility issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.

> core-js@2.6.12 postinstall
> node -e "try{require('./postinstall')}catch(e){}"

Thank you for using core-js ( https://github.com/zloirock/core-js ) for polyfilling JavaScript standard library!

The project needs your help! Please consider supporting of core-js on Open Collective or Patreon:
